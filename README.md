Satellite Monitoring system for the Boosted Space Program (BSP) project. 
Get real time data from the satellites and visualize it inside a MDI (Multiple Document Interface) application for easy access to multiple different data sources at the same time.

# About BSP
The Boosted Space Program (BSP) is a project that aims to create a community of space enthusiasts and professionals to work together on a variety of space projects. The 'Sat-Monitor' project is currently in its early stages, but we are working hard to make it a reality.
